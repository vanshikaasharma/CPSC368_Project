# Digital Health Technologies: Adoption of Electronic Prescribing (eRx) Across the U.S.

## üìÅ Project Overview

This project explores the adoption patterns of electronic prescribing (eRx) across various U.S. states, with a focus on rural vs. urban usage, provider types (NPs, PAs, MDs), and prescription trends.
